# Empty Sinatra Project
An empty sinatra project which uses ActiveRecord for ORM and Postgresql as a DB (this can easily be configured, however, in database.yml under config).

This project also uses a "models" directory for models which it looks for in the root path. It is up to you to create this dir.

Please feel free to use and let me know if you have any suggestions for improvements. Thanks!
